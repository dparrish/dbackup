SERVER INSTALLATION

1. Extract the archive into /home/dbackup
2. Add the following line to /etc/services:

dbackup     38771/tcp

3. Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf (or create a config file if you use xinetd):

38771           stream  tcp     nowait  root    /home/dbackup/dbackup_server

4. Copy the default configuration file dbackup_config to /etc/dbackup/config,
   and edit it. Specifically, make sure the backup_root directive is correct,
   and add regexes to match all the backup client IP addresses to ip_allow.
5. Restart inetd or xinetd (killall -HUP inetd).
6. Add the following lines to /etc/crontab to verify and report on the backups.

0 00 * * 0 root /home/dbackup/dbackup_verify
0 09 * * * root /home/dbackup/dbackup_report


CLIENT INSTALLATION

1. Extract the archive into /home/dbackup
2. Add the following line to /etc/services:

dbackup     38771/tcp

3. Copy the default configuration file dbackup-client.conf to
   /etc/dbackup-client/config, and edit it. At the very least you need to
   change the backup servers to your own.
4. Create an entry in /etc/crontab. It's worthwhile staggering the start times of multiple clients.

0 2 * * * root /home/dbackup/dbackup backup /path/to/filesystem /another/filesystem

5. Wait for the backup to happen. The server will only produce output if there
   is an error, which cron will mail to root. If you want to force a report to
   be generated every run, add the "-r" flag to the command line.
